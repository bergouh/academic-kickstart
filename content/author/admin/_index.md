I am a researcher in the MaIAGE team at INRA in Jouy-en-Josas, France. Currently I am on leave at KAUST, Thuwal, KSA, hosted by Peter Richtarik. I did my PhD at INPT, Toulouse, France, under the supervision of Serge Gratton in Algo team where I worked on
numerical methods for least squares, non convex optimization and data assimilation. I received the Masters degrees in 2011 from ENSTA ParisTech and Paris 1, where I studied Applied maths for finance.
